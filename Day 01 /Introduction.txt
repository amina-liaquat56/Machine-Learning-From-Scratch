Intoduction to Machine Learning 
================================

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Traditional Programming: You write explicit rules.
if email contains "free money", then mark as spam.
Machine Learning: You show the computer many examples of spam and non-spam emails, and it learns the patterns itself.
Input: [1000s of emails] â†’ Output: A model that can predict if a new email is spam.

Key Takeaway: 
ML is about learning from data to make predictions or decisions.
