Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)
====================================================

The Machine Learning Development Life Cycle outlines the process of building and deploying an ML model:

Problem Definition 
=======================================
Understand and define the business or research problem.

Data Collection 
======================================
Gather relevant and high-quality data.

Data Preprocessing 
=======================================
Clean and transform data (handling missing values, normalization, etc.).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
======================================
Understand data patterns, correlations, and outliers.

Model Selection 
=======================================
Choose appropriate ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, etc.).

Model Training 
=======================================
Train the model using the training dataset.

Model Evaluation 
========================================
Test model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.

Hyperparameter Tuning 
========================================
Optimize model parameters to improve performance.

Deployment 
=======================================
Integrate the model into a production environment.

Monitoring & Maintenance 
=======================================
Continuously monitor model performance and update as needed
