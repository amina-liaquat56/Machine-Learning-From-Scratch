Libraries for Implementing Differential Privacy

===============================================
PySyft

=============================================
Developed by OpenMined

Enables Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML)

Tools for:

Federated learning

Secure multi-party computation (SMPC)

Differential privacy

Compatible with PyTorch and TensorFlow

Example: Training a model with remote private datasets


PyTorch Opacus

======================================
Developed by Meta AI

Specifically designed for Differential Privacy in PyTorch

Key Features:

Adds DP during training (e.g., noise injection to gradients)

Supports per-sample gradient clipping

Integrates easily with torch.nn.Module

Use case: Training a neural network while maintaining privacy guarantees.
