Machine Learning Fundamentals
*******************************************

1. Learning Approaches
******************************************

Batch Learning:
- Model is trained on the entire dataset at once.
- Good for static data, but retraining is expensive when new data arrives.

Online Learning:
- Model is trained incrementally, one instance or batch at a time.
- Ideal for streaming data or real-time applications.

Model-Based Learning:
- Learns a model (like linear regression) to make predictions.
- Generalizes from training data to unseen data.
- Examples: Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks.

Instance-Based Learning:
- Memorizes training data and uses it for direct comparison.
- Makes predictions using similar past instances.
- Examples: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


2. Types of Machine Learning
******************************************

Supervised Learning:
- Learns from labeled data (input → output).
- Goal: Predict output for new data.
- Examples: Classification, Regression

Unsupervised Learning:
- Learns from unlabeled data.
- Goal: Discover structure/patterns in data.
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Association Rules

Semi-Supervised Learning:
- Uses small labeled + large unlabeled dataset.
- Cost-effective when labeling is expensive.

Reinforcement Learning:
- Learns by interacting with environment.
- Receives rewards or penalties for actions.
- Goal: Learn a policy to maximize cumulative reward.
- Used in: Robotics, Games, Recommendation Systems


3. Privacy Risks in Learning Approaches
  
************************************************************
  
Supervised Learning: Risks of Label Leakage
- Label Leakage: When labels (or data correlated with labels) are unintentionally exposed or inferred.
- Can lead to model overfitting or exploitation.
- Example: Health diagnosis data — labels might reveal medical conditions.

  ----------------

Unsupervised Learning: Risks in Clustering & Association

Clustering Risks:
- Clusters may group sensitive user identities or behaviors.
- Example: Clustering users based on app usage may reveal private interests.

Association Risks:
- Can reveal hidden relationships between sensitive attributes.
- Example: Association rules in retail data may expose customer buying habits.

Key Takeaways:
- Choose the right learning approach based on data availability and update frequency.
- Understand and mitigate privacy risks in different ML settings.
- Implement privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., differential privacy, federated learning) when needed.
